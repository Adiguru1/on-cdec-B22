      cluster
      nodes{ Master node, Worker nodes}
      pods  (smallest unit of deployment in k8s)

 1) API server > Route the request
 2) ETCD  > Store the data here
 3) Scheduler > Schedule the nodes(server)
 4) Controller Manager > keep the resources in your desired state

  Worker node components
 1) Kubelette > create the pod
 2) container runtime > provide environment to create container inside pod
 3) Kube-proxy > provide the networking (ip-addresses) to the pod

   
Pod > smallest unit of deployment in k8s
    > wrapper in which we create containers 
    > we can create multiple containers in one pod 
    > pod has its own ip address
